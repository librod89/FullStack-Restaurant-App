Create a Full Stack Restaurant application with Vagrant (from the Full Stack Fundamentals Course on Udacity).

1. Create a database and populate it using SQLAlchemy (database_setup.py && lotsofmenus.py).
2. Create a webserver using Python.
3. Using the webserver create a restaurant app that lists restaurants from the DB and lets the user add, update, and delete from the list (webserver.py).
4. Use Flask to rewrite the code from task 3 (project.py). Add routing, templates, message flashing, styling, and API endpoints to get content from the database in the form of JSON.
