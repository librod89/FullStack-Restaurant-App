Create a Full Stack Restaurant application with Vagrant (from the Full Stack Fundamentals Course on Udacity).

1. Create a database and populate it using SQLAlchemy (database_setup.py && lotsofmenus.py).
2. Create a webserver using Python.
3. Using the webserver create a restaurant app that lists restaurants from the DB and lets the user add, update, and delete from the list (webserver.py).
4. Use Flask to rewrite the code from task 3 (project.py). Add routing, templates, message flashing, styling, and API endpoints to get content from the database in the form of JSON.
5. Use Flask to finish project (finalProject.py). App should show list of restaurants with options to create new, edit, delete, and show Menu Items. Menu Items page should have options to create, edit, and delete. Also include API endpoints and CSS Styling.
